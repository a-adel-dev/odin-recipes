    <h3>Good old fashioned pancakes</h3>
    <p class="desc">Everyday Pan cakes recipe</p>

    <p>
      The basic pancake is made from a simple batter of eggs, flour, milk and
      baking powder for leavening. You can use different types of flour if you
      want to experiment with whole wheat or buckwheat. And you can also add
      fruit to the mixture. The batter can be made from scratch in about the
      same time it takes to make toast.
    </p>

    <p>
      The most time-consuming part of making pancakes, of course, is cooking
      them. But that time is so short you should consider these an everyday
      convenience food, not a special-occasion feast. Cook this recipe a few
      times and it may become part of your weekly routine.

    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour/li></li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon sugar, optional</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 1/2 to 2 cups milk</li>
      <li>
        2 tablespoons melted and cooled butter (optional), plus unmelted butter
        for cooking, or use neutral oil
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a griddle or large skillet over medium-low heat. In a bowl, mix
        together dry ingredients. Beat eggs into 1 1/2 cups milk, then stir in 2
        tablespoons melted cooled butter, if using it. Gently stir this mixture
        into dry ingredients, mixing only enough to moisten flour; don't worry
        about a few lumps. If batter seems thick, add a little more milk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a teaspoon or 2 of butter or oil on griddle or skillet. When
        butter foam subsides or oil shimmers, ladle batter onto griddle or
        skillet, making pancakes of any size you like. Adjust heat as necessary;
        usually, first batch will require higher heat than subsequent batches.
        Flip pancakes after bubbles rise to surface and bottoms brown, after 2
        to 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook until second side is lightly browned. Serve, or hold on an
        ovenproof plate in a 200-degree oven for up to 15 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
